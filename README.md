# Hello, Seattle!

# Intel Industrial IoT Workshop Setup Guide
Welcome to the Intel Industrial IoT Workshop. In this workshop, we will explore Industry 4.0 technologies through lectures and hands on labs. By the end of the workshop, you should have a solid understanding of different Industry 4.0 technologies and have some working ideas of how to implement them in your place of business.

Today you will learn about:
- Intel’s Industrial IoT Strategy
- The Aaeon UP Squared Board and Developer tools 
- The AI Solutions from IEI
- Intel’s workload consolidation strategy 
- Protocols and Sensors in Industrial IoT 
- Intel powered security for Industrial IoT 

You will also see demos around workload consolidation and have a chance to get hands on with some of Intel’s Industrial reference implementations and EdgeX Foundry – an open source fog architecture for Industrial IoT.   


The links below will guide the workshop attendee through the slides, videos and labs in the Intel Industrial IoT Workshop.



The Intel IoT Developer Relations team, hopes that you enjoy this IIoT Workshop.
